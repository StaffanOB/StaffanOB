# About me
I'm a proud family man with an amazing wife and two fantastic kids who keep
life exciting and full of love.

We are all about the great outdoors! Whether it's hunting,  hiking, or camping,
we love getting out there and experiencing nature together. There's something
really special about those adventures that makes us a tighter-knit family.

When we're not on the road or out in the wild, we love spending time at our
cabin in the Swedish mountains skiing in the winter and hiking in the summer.

I'm also working on building an overland car. It's a fun and challenging
project, and I can't wait to take it on our next big adventure. Customizing it
to suit our needs and knowing it'll take us to some incredible places makes it
all the more exciting.

Back at home, I've been diving into the world of smart home automation. It's
been a cool project to take on, making our home more efficient. This also track
well with my work as a test automation engineer.

Balancing family life, outdoor adventures, and personal interests has given me
a unique perspective on what truly matters. Every moment spent with my loved
ones is a gift, and I'm grateful for it all.
